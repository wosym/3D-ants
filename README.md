# 3D-Ants

Repository of 3D objects (and possibly other useful tools in the future) that can be used by antkeeping hobbyists. 


### Tubecoupler

Basic parametric model that couples two testtubes (or a testtube and a flextube) to eachother, so a colony can be migrated from an old tube to a new one (e.g. to refresh the water supply, or to save them from a moldy tube).


#### How to use?

* Fill in the diameters of both tubes
* Select the requested length of the coupler (larger coupler will be more stable, but will obscure more vision)
* Depending on your 3D printer you might need to adjust to `mod` parameter to make the fit tighter or looser. 

### Tubecover

Parametric model of a cover that slides over a testtube. There is the option to add the species name embossed on the side of the cover. 

#### How to use?

* Fill in the tube diameter, length and other (optional) parameters
* Optionally fill in the species name in the `side_text` parameter, or fill in an empty string for no text.
