### Tubecoupler

Basic parametric model that couples two testtubes (or a testtube and a flextube) to eachother, so a colony can be migrated from an old tube to a new one (e.g. to refresh the water supply, or to save them from a moldy tube).

#### How to use?

* Fill in the diameters of both tubes
* Select the requested length of the coupler (larger coupler will be more stable, but will obscure more vision)
* Depending on your 3D printer you might need to adjust to `mod` parameter to make the fit tighter or looser.
